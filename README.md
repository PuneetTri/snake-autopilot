# Snake Autopilot

This project initially started as an attempt to recreate the nostalgic snake game using ReactJS. However, it quickly transformed into a challenging project focused on helping me to win the game atleast for once ðŸ¥². Struggling to play the game led me to design of feature, which with the help of pathfinding algorithms gave me a quickboost into the game, I call this feature "Autopilot." The project is not only just a snake game, it also serves as a demonstration of how path-finding algorithms can be used to solve seemingly trivial challenges, such as playing a snake game, and showcases their potential applications in the gaming industry, particularly in facilitating NPC navigation.
